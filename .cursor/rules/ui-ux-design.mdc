# UI/UX Design Rules

## Design Philosophy

**Premium Product Showcase:**
- Create "wow" factor through cinematic experience
- Emphasize visual storytelling over text-heavy content
- Demonstrate cutting-edge front-end development skills
- Target design-forward tech companies and creative agencies

## Visual Design Trends (Mid-2025)

**Cinematic Approach:**
- Full-screen video backgrounds instead of static images
- Minimal text overlays with high impact
- Smooth, film-like transitions between sections
- High-quality, professional-grade assets

**Physicality & Tactile Feel:**
- UI elements should feel tangible and real
- Subtle gradients and shadows for depth
- Physics-based animations that mimic real-world behavior
- Responsive micro-interactions on hover/touch

**Generative AI Accents:**
- Small section with AI-generated art/patterns
- Subtle shifting patterns representing "clean air" effect
- Tasteful integration, not overwhelming

## Typography & Layout

**Font Requirements:**
- Variable font (Inter or Hubot Sans recommended)
- Fine-tuned weight adjustments for optimal hierarchy
- Highly legible across all device sizes
- Preload font files using React 19 `<Asset>` tag

**Bento Grid 2.0:**
- Evolved grid layout for feature showcase
- Hover-to-expand functionality for grid cells
- Embedded micro-visualizations within cells
- Responsive grid that adapts to screen size

**Layout Hierarchy:**
1. Hero video with minimal text overlay
2. Scroll-driven animated storytelling sections
3. Interactive Bento Grid features
4. Waitlist form with smooth submission
5. Clean, minimal footer

## Color & Visual Style

**Premium Air Purifier Aesthetic:**
- Clean, minimal color palette
- Whites, soft grays, and subtle blues
- Accent colors for interactive elements
- High contrast for accessibility compliance

**Visual Effects:**
- Particle systems for air quality visualization
- Smooth gradients and subtle shadows
- Glowing effects for connectivity/smart features
- Clean, modern iconography

## Responsive Design Requirements

**Mobile-First Approach:**
- Simplified animation sequences for mobile performance
- Touch-friendly interaction areas (minimum 44px)
- Optimized asset loading for mobile networks
- Maintained visual hierarchy across breakpoints

**Device Adaptation:**
- Desktop: Full cinematic experience with all animations
- Tablet: Intermediate experience with key animations
- Mobile: Streamlined experience focused on core message
- Consider device capabilities and performance limits

## Interaction Patterns

**Scroll Behavior:**
- Smooth scroll with momentum (not instant jumps)
- Clear visual feedback for scroll progress
- Pinned sections with fluid transitions
- Scroll-driven animation timing that feels natural

**Micro-Interactions:**
- Hover states with subtle animation feedback
- Loading states that feel intentional, not accidental
- Form validation with inline, helpful feedback
- Button interactions with satisfying tactile response

**Navigation:**
- Scroll-based navigation (single page experience)
- Optional navigation dots/progress indicator
- Smooth section-to-section transitions
- Clear call-to-action hierarchy
